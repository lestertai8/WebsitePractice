                The purpose of my website is to help users plan a trip to Walt Disney World. 
                There are so many rides to ride, attractions to see, and characters to meet â€“ it is impossible to do it all in one vacation. 
                A trip to Disney World is extremely expensive, so it is important to plan ahead in order to get as much out of your vacation as possible.
